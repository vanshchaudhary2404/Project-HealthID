# Project_HealthID
"To develop an innovative NFC/RFID-based healthcare solution that digitizes patient data access, addressing the critical issue of delayed emergency response due to inefficient manual processes in hospitals."
## HealthID 🏥💳
HealthID is a smart web portal designed for hospitals and healthcare centers to instantly access a patient's complete medical history with a single RFID scan. The platform 
aims to reduce manual data entry, save time, and provide quick access to life-saving information — streamlining the entire patient management system.

## 🔍 Project Overview
HealthID transforms how hospitals manage patient data. With the simple scan of an RFID card or tag, the system fetches all medical records linked to the patient, including:

 - Personal information
 - Past diagnoses
 - Medications and allergies
 - Lab reports
 - Visit history
 - All the data is securely stored and managed through a modern web interface with real-time access.
